## What are the benefits of hyper-personalization?
1. Enhanced customer experience.
2. Increased conversion rates.
3. Improved customer retention and lifetime value.
4. Optimized marketing spend.

## How does Customer Journey.js achieve this?
CustomerJourney.js is made up of 3 parts:
1. **Code:** Defines the sales funnel as a Web App.
2. **Template:** The structure of the sales funnel.
3. **Content:** The content described in a JSON object easily understood by AI agents.

Based on customer classification, available data, and a JSON object representing generic content, content variables can be created to significantly improve the convertibility of the sales funnel.

Using customer classification, customer data available in business systems, and a JSON object representing the generic content of a sales funnel page, content variables can be created to significantly improve sales funnel convertibility.

The scrollStopping object allows you to understand a customer's historical behavior within the sales funnel, making it a very powerful tool for AI-powered hyper-personalization.
