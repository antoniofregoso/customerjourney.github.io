        <p>CustomerJourney.js has a code section that defines the structure of the sales funnel and a JSON object that defines the content, design, and animations. This JSON object is easily understood by any <b>generative AI</b>, allowing the sales funnel's appearance and behavior to be adapted based on the available data. It also provides a prompt for an AI agent that will generate the necessary variations based on the sales strategy.</p>
        <p>CustomerJourney uses macro components, each representing a section of a funnel page. Content, design, and animations can be generated in workflow systems with AI agents like n8n, with the level of customization limited only by your data and your imagination.</p>

        <p>CustomerJourney.js is a set of JavaScript libraries designed to create landing pages, funnels, and touchpoints with one goal in mind: <b>hyper-personalization</b> of the user experience with AI.</p>
        <h2>The concept is based on macro components:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Approach as a Web App as a system</p></li>
            <li><p>Each macro component represents an HTML5 section with a layout based on the Bulma style library.</p></li>
            <li><p>The component has no classes, animations, or text.</p></li>
            <li><p>The content, Bulma and custom classes, and animations are passed as a JSON object.</p></li>
            <li><p>Each page detects user behavior and stores it in a Redux state.</p></li>
            <li><p>The page receives information through route parameters and query parameters.</p></li>
            <li><p>The behavior is sent to the backend along with the route and query parameters.</p></li>
            <li><p>From these parameters, the behavior history, and customer information stored in the business management system, an AI can generate a JSON that represents the content, styles, and animations according to the customer profile.</p></li>
            <li><p>CustumerJourney.js is multilingual, has light and dark themes, and animations based on the Animate.css library.</p></li>
            <li><p>CustumerJourney.js is a free, open-source library.</p></li>
        </ol>
